In this challenge, you will create an interface for listing and filtering recipes.

## Topics
With this challeng, I learn:

## Requirements
You will need the NodeJS (LTS or Current) installed on your machine. 

### Tasks

[x] When entering a text in the `input` within the `Navbar` component, `RecipeItems` should be filtered, both by `title` and `ingredients`;
[x] The filter should be `case insensitive`;
[x] (Bonus) highlight the searched text within the `title` and `ingredients` using the tag `<mark>`;
